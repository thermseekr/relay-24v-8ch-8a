# RELAY-24V-8CH

Relay board with 8x 24 VDC 10A relays. This board is designed to be used togheter with [ESP-24V-16CH](https://github.com/thermseekr/esp-24v-16ch) and [ESP-24V-32CH](https://github.com/thermseekr/esp-24v-32ch), but can be driven by any 24V control circuit compatible with NPN inputs.

The dimensions are such that the board can be mounted on a PCB DIN rail holder from the Brazilian manufacturer Metaltex, check [here](https://www.metaltex.com.br/produtos/componentes/suportes/sp7-suporte-para-montagem-de-placa-de-circuito-impresso-em-trilho-din) for details.

Board V1 uses Omron 16A relays and is limited to 12A/channel, board V2 uses Omron 10A relays and is limited to 8A/channel. The current limits are imposed per copper trace capacity.
